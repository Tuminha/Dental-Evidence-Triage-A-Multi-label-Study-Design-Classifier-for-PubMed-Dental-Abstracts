One of the goals of functional-appliance devices is to modify the vertical growth pattern, solving several kinds of malocclusion. This study aimed to evaluate Class II malocclusion treatment's stability with Austro Repositioner, followed by fixed appliances, and assess its capacity to modify vertical dimensions in brachyfacial patients. A test group of 30 patients (16 boys and 14 girls, mean 11.9 years old) with Class II malocclusion due to mandibular retrognathism and brachyfacial pattern treated with Austro Repositioner and fixed appliance were compared to a matched untreated Class II control group of 30 patients (17 boys and 13 girls, mean age 11.7 years old). Lateral cephalograms were taken at T1 (initial records), T2 (end of treatment), and T3 (one year after treatment). Statistical comparisons were performed with a paired-sample  t -test and two-sample  t -tests. Significant improvements in the skeletal Class II relationship were observed in the treated group. The ANB angle decreased (4.75°), the SNB angle increased (3.92°), and the total mandibular length (Co-Pg) increased (8.18 mm) ( p <  0.001). Vertical dimensions were also significantly modified, the FMA angle increased (3.94°), LAFH-distance increased (3.15 mm), and overbite decreased (3.35 mm). These changes remained stable one year after treatment. The Austro Repositioner was adequate for treating the skeletal Class II malocclusion resulting from the mandible retrusion in brachyfacial patients.\", 'label_vec': [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], '__index_level_0__': 1347}\n",

Even though dietary sugars are the most important nutrient for caries development, the disease process is dependent on other dietary practices. The intake of individual nutrient components cannot be evaluated separately from the overall diet which includes other nutrients, foods and habits. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between adherence to dietary guidelines and dental caries. This study was embedded in the Generation R Study, conducted in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In total, 2911 children were included in the present analyses. Dietary intake at the age of 8\\u2009years was assessed using food-frequency questionnaires. Diet quality scores were estimated, reflecting adherence to Dutch dietary guidelines. Dental caries was assessed at the age of 13\\u2009years using intra-oral photographs. Associations were estimated using multinomial logistic regression analyses, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and oral hygiene practices. The prevalence of dental caries at the age of 13\\u2009years was 33% (n\\u2009=\\u2009969). Better diet quality was associated with a lower occurrence of severe dental caries after adjustments for sociodemographic factors [e.g. highest vs. lowest quartile of diet quality: odds ratio (OR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-0.98]. After additional adjustments for oral hygiene practices, this association was not statistically significant (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.41-1.03). Adherence to dietary guidelines has the potential to reduce dental caries in children; however, with proper oral hygiene practices, this relationship might be attenuated. To understand the role of dietary patterns and dental caries, the contributing role of daily eating occasions needs to be studied further.', 'label_vec': [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], '__index_level_0__': 1007}\n",
